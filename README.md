# Advent of Code 2022
This is my take on solving the 2022 Advent of Code Challenges 

## Let's rewind to December 2022...
When the 2022 advent of code challenges were released, I had only just started learning HTML and CSS and had no other prior coding experience. So although 'tis not the season and quite literally the middle of summer, I thought these were high quality katas that would be great ractice (and fun)!

Other than just solving the problem to get the solution, I have also...

- written and tested parser function that parse the raw data into a usuable form
- followed the 'single responsibility principle' by keeping each function small and have a specific purpose
- written unit tests using Jest

## Setup/installation

If you would like to clone this repo onto your local machine follow these steps:

1. create a repository that you would like to contain this code and cd into it, if you haven't already
2. in your terminal, run the command `git clone https://github.com/nicole-lancaster/advent-of-code-2022.git`
3. make sure you have Node installed to run the files
4. run `npm install` to install all depnendencies need to run this project

## Future plans

1. to create more Jest tests for each function to full cover 'happy path' and 'sad path logic'
2. fully utilise more TypeScript features in my code to help improve my coding productivity and improve the number of potential bugs in my code
3. complete all katas!

## Feedback/suggestions

First of all, if you read any of my code, thank you! I would be extremly grateful for any feedback on ways to improve. Please just reach out to me on LinkedIn, raise a pull request, or submit an issue!
